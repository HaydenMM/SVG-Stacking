# SVG-Stacking
This repo will allow someone to stack a collection of SVG's ONTOP of eachother. I have seen a few repos attempt to do this but seem to either concatenate, or inproperly assign the classes. NOTE: This repo is specific to an NFT project I am working on so it may not be the best option for your scenario.
